- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I made a kind of fantastical bug that has a little bag you can put things inside of. It can fly around or walk and includes user interaction with the examine() method.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I made an overriden default constructor to make things a little easier while testing 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Definitely referring back to previous assingments was helpful for this go around. Having to come up with method functions by myself was fun! Sticking to the call signatures in Contract.java was tough though. I often found myself wanting to change them around a little.
